# Reliability and Scaling

The ScalarTax API is architected to provide consistent, high-performance operations. It supports various key business processes like account management, customer data handling, transactions, and more. The API is built with features to ensure reliability and scalability.

**High Availability and Auto-Scaling** ScalarHub API dynamically adjusts resources based on demand with auto-scaling infrastructure, minimizing downtime through multi-region deployment and ensuring seamless failover during any failure.

**Efficient Traffic Management and Load Distribution** ScalarHub utilizes an API gateway for traffic management, applying rate limiting to prevent overload. Load balancing across backend servers ensures even distribution of requests, maintaining performance under high volumes.

**Proactive Monitoring, Error Handling, and Security** Proactive monitoring with tools like Prometheus allows quick detection and resolution of performance issues. Automated error logging, metrics collection, and retry strategies ensure reliable responses, while security measures such as API firewalls and OAuth 2.0 protect against malicious traffic.

### Reliability Framework Workload Categories
ScalarHub provides tailored recommendations for different workload types to ensure optimal reliability and performance:

| Category                | Recommendations                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Event Ingestion**      | Validate payloads before submission (e.g., creating accounts or transactions). Use exponential backoff to retry 503 Service Unavailable errors. Maintain a buffer for retries within system thresholds to prevent delays. |
| **Read-Only Queries**    | Use pagination (`?page`, `?size`) to handle large datasets like `/customers` and `/transactions`. Employ caching for frequently accessed endpoints like `/products` to reduce response times. For query timeouts, retry with appropriate intervals and monitor latency. |
| **Critical Write Actions** | Implement error handling for `POST /accounts` and `POST /subscriptions` to ensure data consistency. Validate responses to prevent duplicate submissions. Enterprise users should leverage SLA-backed uptime commitments for uninterrupted processing of mission-critical writes. |
