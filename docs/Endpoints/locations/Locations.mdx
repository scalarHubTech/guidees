The `LocationsAPI` handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing location records. Locations represent physical or virtual locations associated with entities. The controller supports creating new locations, viewing existing locations, updating location details, and deleting locations. Locations can also have associated attributes that are managed through the controller.
