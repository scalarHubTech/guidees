The `SLNexusesAPI` handles operations related to managing SL Nexus records, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records. It ensures transactional updates for nested data and provides error handling for validation, bad requests, and missing documents. The controller supports bulk creation and updates for Nexus entries and integrates user context for record management.
