The `Customers` API is a core component of the ScalarHub tax calculation system, designed to manage customer-related data and ensure accurate tax computation. This API ensures that businesses can efficiently maintain customer profiles while facilitating the seamless integration of customer-specific tax rules and exemptions into the ScalarHub tax engine. Enabling streamlined management of customer information enhances the overall efficiency of tax-related operations.

### Use Cases
One of the primary use cases of the `Customers` API is to enable tax calculation systems to account for customer-specific attributes, such as tax exemption statuses or geographic exposure zones, which can significantly impact tax rates and applicability. For instance, businesses can define and retrieve customer tax exemption details, ensuring compliance with jurisdiction-specific tax regulations. Additionally, the API supports comprehensive address and contact management, enabling companies to maintain accurate location-based data, which is critical for determining tax exposure zones. This functionality makes it easier to calculate and apply region-specific tax rates with precision.

Furthermore, the `Customers` API plays a vital role in automating tax workflows by integrating customer profiles with the ScalarHub tax calculation engine. It allows seamless retrieval and management of customer data during transactions, ensuring tax computations dynamically adapt to customer-specific parameters. The `Customers` API is a cornerstone for building scalable, efficient, and compliant tax solutions in ScalarHub.
