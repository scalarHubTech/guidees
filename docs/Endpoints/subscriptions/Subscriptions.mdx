The `SubscriptionAPI` manages the lifecycle of customer subscriptions, providing functionality for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting subscription records. Subscriptions represent a customerâ€™s engagement with a plan and track details such as billing cycles, activation dates, and service periods.

- **Lifecycle Management**: Includes creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of subscriptions.
- **Billing and Activation**: Supports billing cycle alignment, contract dates, and activation or termination dates.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Tracks critical attributes such as status, billing amount, and account association.

This controller ensures robust handling of subscription records through secure parameter handling and integrates business logic via a dedicated `SubscriptionService` class.
