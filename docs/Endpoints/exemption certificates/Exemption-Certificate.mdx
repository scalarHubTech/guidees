The `ExemptionCertificatesAPI` is responsible for managing exemption certificates within the application. These certificates track tax exemptions for entities or accounts, providing details such as customer names, expiration dates, and tax exemption statuses. The controller supports the `Download` operation along with the CRUD operations.
