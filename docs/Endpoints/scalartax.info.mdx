## Detailed Status Code Descriptions

### HTTP 200 OK

The request was successfully processed by the server. The response will contain the requested data.

### HTTP 201 Created

The request was successful and resulted in the creation of a new resource. The response will include a location header pointing to the new resource.

### HTTP 204 No Content

The request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response. This is typically used for successful deletions.

### HTTP 400 Bad Request

The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax. The client should not repeat the request without modifications.

### HTTP 404 Not Found

The server can not find the requested resource. This can also be returned when the server does not want to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or no other response is applicable.

### HTTP 500 Internal Server Error

The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This is a generic error message for unexpected conditions.

### HTTP 503 Service Unavailable

An HTTP 503 response from our servers indicates there is an unexpected spike in API access traffic. The server is usually operational within the next five minutes. If the outage persists or you receive any other form of an HTTP 5XX error, contact support.
