The `LocationAttributesAPI` is responsible for managing the attributes associated with locations. These attributes provide detailed information about an area, such as its physical characteristics or other custom details that must be tracked. The controller supports operations to create, retrieve, update, and delete location attributes.

Location attributes are managed by the current user, ensuring user-specific access control.
