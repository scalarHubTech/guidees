Welcome to the **ScalarTax API Reference** documentation. The ScalarTax API enables developers to perform comprehensive operations related to tax management, including managing customers, accounts, products, transactions, locations, and more. Built on REST principles, the API ensures predictable URLs and a seamless integration experience.

1. **Intuitive Design**: The ScalarTax API follows RESTful architecture, making it accessible and predictable for developers. Each resource is exposed as a unique URL, simplifying requests and integrations.
2. **Comprehensive Operations**: The API supports CRUD operations for all major resources, including Customers, Accounts, Users, and Subscriptions, with detailed support for advanced configurations like exemption certificates and location attributes.
3. **Real-Time and Scalable**: Designed to handle high throughput, the ScalarTax API ensures reliability for real-time operations, including transaction processing and account management.
4. **Standardized Responses**: The API provides detailed and actionable error messages, making debugging efficient and straightforward.
